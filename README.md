# BusLines Project

## Background

The **BusLines** project is a C# application focused on managing bus lines. It stores information about bus companies, stations, departure times, and more. The system can display detailed routes for each bus line, indicating which cities it passes through. The main feature, however, is to assist users in traveling from one station to another using one or two buses.

## Installation Instructions

1. Extract the project folder to the directory.
2. Navigate to the `Release` folder inside the extracted project directory.
3. Run the `Buslines.exe` file to start the application. Optionally, you can create a shortcut to this executable file and place it anywhere on your computer for easier access.

## General Overview

The system stores data about bus lines, stations, and departure times. Using this information, it can:
- Display detailed routes for each bus line, including estimated arrival times at each station.
- Provide focused searches through reports, such as displaying all lines that pass through a specific station.
- Offer users travel routes from one station to another using one or two buses.

The goal of this system is to improve bus usage efficiency and provide extensive information to users, encouraging the use of environmentally friendly public transportation.

## Target Audience

This system is designed for anyone interested in using public transportation to reach their destination.
